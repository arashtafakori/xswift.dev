# Get Started

Article **.** 12/25/2023 **.** [Arash Tafakori](https://github.com/arashtafakori)

We start a journey and go forward together. We start the tutorial with an example. Step-by-step we do all levels of implementations, from identifying requirements to implementing APIs or Other endpoints by testing them. Note that this tutorial does not include the deployment phase.

The example is a simple task management application that is inspired by Scrum board, and it has been implemented based on [XSwift version 1.3.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XSwift/).

[Repository of the example on github](https://github.com/xswift-project/example-xswift-task-management/tree/based-on-efcore)
